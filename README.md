# BackboardXamarin
Manual port to .NET (Xamarin Android) of Tumblr Backboard lib and Facebook Rebound lib samples using the also manually ported to c# Backboard lib:

(Depends on it to work)

Tumblr Backboard is a framework on top of Rebound that makes it easier to use by coupling it to views and motions. This Xamarin port of the Backboard and Rebound original samples ports all of the samples to Xamarin Android (.net) code using ALWAYS Backboard syntax. The goal of the library is to compile together all the samples from both libraries (Rebound and Backboard) into a single and easy to use xamarin framework language (Xamarin Backboard).


Based on original Tumblr and Facebook java projects:
